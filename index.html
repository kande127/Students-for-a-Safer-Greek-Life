    <h1>We are a committee of students dedicated to educating and preventing Gender- and Power-based violence within the Greek Life community at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.</h1>
    <h2>The goal of this committee is to get representatives from each Greek Life chapter affiliated with the Cal Poly campus to to present at these meetings. Here, we discuss the most important and significant topics to focus on and have been developing biweekly newsletters to disperse to the Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL) offices.</h2>
    <p>After COVID-19, the committee hopes to be able to conduct train the trainer sessions for members of Greek Life.</p>
