    <h1>We are Students for a SAFER Greek Life</h1>
    <h2>A committee of students dedicated to educating and preventing gender- and power-based violence within the Greek Life community at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.</h2>
    <h3>The goal of this committee is to get representatives from each Greek Life chapter affiliated with the Cal Poly campus to to present at these meetings. Here, we discuss the most important and significant topics to focus on and have been developing biweekly newsletters to disperse to the Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL) offices.</h3>
    <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee hopes to be able to conduct training sessions for members of Greek Life to become more involved in the community.</p>
